# Specification Quality Checklist: Update Results Query Schema for Structured Verdict

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-16
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Schema-only change; all requirements are schema/contract level — no Java or viewstore work.
- SC-003 has a nuance: the existing `hmcts.results.v1.json` uses `"ref"` (not `"$ref"`) — the plan phase should confirm how the framework resolves this reference and whether to replace it inline or update the ref target.
- The `hmcts.get-case-results.v1.json` example file (no active RAML route) is explicitly out of scope; flagged in Assumptions.
